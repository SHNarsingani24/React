# React
Repository for all React.js codes, while leaening React as well as making projects in react.

# Getting Started
In this document I basically used CDN links for React and done basic code of how things actually work in React. Also came to know about concept of react-dom.

# Free-code-camp
I am learning React.js basics from a video of free-code-camp and in this folder there are two subfolders: ``` course-projects ``` and ``` solo-projects ```. In this video instructor teaches fundamentals of React.js section by section, in each section I do a mini-project with instructor (in **course-projects**) and at the end of each section I do one solo-project (given by instructor, in **solo-projects**).
